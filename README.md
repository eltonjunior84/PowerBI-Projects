# PowerBI-Projects

Welcome! This repository showcases a collection of interactive dashboards I developed using Power BI.

Each folder contains a different project, including the dashboard file and a README.md with details about the data preparation (ETL) process and the visual design choices made during development.

Feel free to explore the dashboards and gain insights into my approach to data storytelling and business intelligence.
